# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces the current file upload system in articles and gallery sections with Google Drive integration. Instead of uploading files directly to the server, users will provide Google Drive links, and the system will fetch and display the files directly from Google Drive. This approach will significantly reduce server storage usage while maintaining the same user experience for viewing photos and videos.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to use Google Drive links instead of uploading files directly, so that I can save server storage space while still sharing photos and videos in articles and gallery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or edits an article THEN the system SHALL provide an input field for Google Drive links instead of file upload
2. WHEN a user creates or edits a gallery item THEN the system SHALL provide an input field for Google Drive links instead of file upload
3. WHEN a user provides a Google Drive link THEN the system SHALL validate that the link is a valid Google Drive URL
4. WHEN a valid Google Drive link is provided THEN the system SHALL store the link in the database
5. IF the Google Drive link points to a single file THEN the system SHALL display that single file
6. IF the Google Drive link points to a folder with multiple files THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all accessible files from that folder

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing articles or gallery, I want to see photos and videos from Google Drive seamlessly integrated, so that I have the same viewing experience regardless of the file source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying an article with Google Drive media THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the media files as if they were locally stored
2. WHEN displaying gallery items with Google Drive media THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all media files from the provided Google Drive links
3. WHEN fetching Google Drive files THEN the system SHALL handle both individual files and folder contents
4. WHEN displaying fetched media THEN the system SHALL maintain the same UI/UX as the current file display system
5. WHEN media files are successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL cache the file information for improved performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to receive clear feedback about Google Drive link accessibility, so that I know whether my shared files can be accessed by the system and users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a Google Drive link THEN the system SHALL check if the file/folder is publicly accessible
2. IF a Google Drive file/folder is private or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display an error message stating "File is private and cannot be accessed by the server"
3. WHEN checking Google Drive accessibility THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback during the input process
4. IF a Google Drive link becomes inaccessible after being saved THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and display a fallback message
5. WHEN a Google Drive link is successfully validated THEN the system SHALL confirm accessibility to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Google Drive integration to be reliable and performant, so that users have a smooth experience when viewing media content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching Google Drive files THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling for network failures
2. WHEN multiple files are being fetched from a Google Drive folder THEN the system SHALL fetch them efficiently without blocking the UI
3. WHEN Google Drive API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
4. WHEN displaying fetched media THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for better performance
5. WHEN Google Drive files are fetched THEN the system SHALL cache metadata to reduce API calls

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the Google Drive integration to be backward compatible, so that existing articles and gallery items continue to work without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is deployed THEN existing articles with uploaded files SHALL continue to display correctly
2. WHEN the new system is deployed THEN existing gallery items with uploaded files SHALL continue to display correctly
3. WHEN displaying media content THEN the system SHALL automatically detect whether files are local uploads or Google Drive links
4. WHEN migrating to the new system THEN the database schema SHALL support both local file paths and Google Drive links
5. WHEN rendering media content THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate display method based on the file source type
